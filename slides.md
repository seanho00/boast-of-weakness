## 2 Corinthians 11:18-30

## 2 Cor 11:18-21a

Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. 

You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! 

In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. 

To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!

----------------------------------------

## 2 Cor 11:21b-22

Whatever anyone else dares to boast about -- I am speaking as a fool --
I also dare to boast about.

Are they Hebrews? So am I.
Are they Israelites? So am I.
Are they Abrahamâ€™s descendants? So am I. 

----------------------------------------

## 2 Cor 11:23-27

Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more.

I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. 

Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. 
Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, 

I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers.

I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. 

----------------------------------------

## 2 Cor 11:28-30

Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. 

Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?

If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
