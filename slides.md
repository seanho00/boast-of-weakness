</div>

>>>
1. Dishonour: Corinthians ashamed of Paul
2. Alluding to the content of his boast
3. Corinthians were **impressed** by the boasting
* Paul is not **stooping** to their level, but
  + **Deflating** their claims, in order to

4. *Concern* (v28-30)

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:21b-22 (NIV)

Whatever anyone else **dares** to boast about -- <br/>
I am speaking as a **fool** -- <br/>
**I also** dare to boast about.

Are they **Hebrews**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Israelites**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Abraham’s descendants**? So am I. 

>>>
*dare*: bold, brash, unashamed
+ Paul knows boasting is foolishness
  + 12:1 no profit
  + 11:16 don't deem him to be a fool

----------------------------------------

## 2. Credentials

* Paul **matches** the charlatans' credentials:
* "Hebrews": **nationality**
  + Preserve language / culture
* "Israelites": **theocracy**
  + Preserve covenant with God
* "Abraham's descendants": **Messianic right**
  + Preserve hope of eternal inheritance

>>>
+ Deflate prestige of charlatans
  + 12:11 no less, but also nothing
+ (Jam1:9-10 poor/rich boast in high/low)

----------------------------------------

## Philippians 3:4b-7 (NIV)

If someone else thinks they have reasons <br/>
to put **confidence** in the flesh, I have **more**:

**circumcised** on the eighth day, of the people of **Israel**, <br/>
of the **tribe** of Benjamin, a **Hebrew** of Hebrews; <br/>
in regard to the **law**, a Pharisee; <br/>
as for **zeal**, persecuting the church; <br/>
as for **righteousness** based on the law, faultless.

But whatever were **gains** to me <br/>
I now consider **loss** for the sake of Christ.

Are they **servants** of Christ? <br/>
(I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am **more**.

I have **worked** much harder, <br/>
been in **prison** more frequently, <br/>
been **flogged** more severely, <br/>
and been exposed to **death** again and again. 

>>>
+ **Exceeds** the charlatans
  + **not** servants of Christ, but of Satan (11:15)
  + not about **degrees** of being a servant
+ Outline of following:
  + 24-25 Beatings
  + 26 Danger of death
  + 27 Toil

----------------------------------------

## Beatings 11:24-25 (NIV)

**Five** times I received from the Jews <br/>
the forty **lashes** minus one. <br/>
**Three** times I was **beaten** with rods, <br/>
**once** I was pelted with **stones**,

**three** times I was **shipwrecked**, <br/>
I spent a night and a day in the open **sea**,

I have been constantly on the **move**.

>>>
+ Beatings and floggings
+ "Not what Paul has **done**, but what he has **bourne** (Robertson)

I have been in danger from **rivers**, in danger from **bandits**, <br/>
in danger from my fellow **Jews**, in danger from **Gentiles**; <br/>
in danger in the **city**, in danger in the **country**, <br/>
in danger at **sea**; and in danger from **false believers**.

I have **labored** and **toiled** <br/>
and have often gone without **sleep**; <br/>
I have known **hunger** and **thirst** <br/>
and have often gone without **food**; <br/>
I have been **cold** and **naked**. 

>>>
+ Dangers
+ Toil
+ Not for guilt-trip, thanks, or admiration
  + Approval comes from God (10:18), not man
  + Normal Christian life

----------------------------------------

## 3. Crises

>>>
+ Different from typical Chinese whining:
+ Not sufferings overcome by **own** strength
+ But own **frailty**, inability to overcome
  + Glory goes to **God**, not self

----------------------------------------

## 1 Corinthians 1:26-29 (NIV)
God chose the **foolish** things of the world <br/>
to shame the **wise**; <br/>
God chose the **weak** things of the world <br/>
to shame the strong.

God chose the **lowly** things of this world <br/>
and the **despised** things -- <br/>
and the things that are **not** -- <br/>
to nullify the things that **are**,

that **no one** may boast before him.

----------------------------------------

## 1 Corinthians 1:26-29 (NIV)
It is because of him that you are in **Christ Jesus**, <br/>
who has become for us **wisdom** from God -- <br/>
that is, our **righteousness**, **holiness** and **redemption**.

Therefore, as it is written: <br/>
“Let the one who boasts **boast in the Lord**.”

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:28-30 (NIV)

Besides everything else, <br/>
I face daily the pressure of my **concern** for all the churches.

Who is **weak**, and I do not feel **weak**? <br/>
