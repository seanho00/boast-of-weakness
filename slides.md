<span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">
Since many are **boasting** in the way the world does, <br/>
**I too** will boast.
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2">
You gladly **put up** with fools since you are so **wise**! <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment" style="color:#1b91ff" data-fragment-index="2">
[You: Corinthians]
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2">
In fact, you even put up with anyone 
</span>
<span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="1">
who **enslaves** you <br/>
or **exploits** you or **takes advantage** of you <br/>
or puts on **airs** or **slaps** you in the face. <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment" style="color:#ff2c2d" data-fragment-index="1">
[They: Charlatans]
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">
To my shame I admit that we were too **weak** for that! <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment" style="color:#17ff2e" data-fragment-index="3">
[We: Christ's servants]
</span>

----------------------------------------

## 1a. They: Charlatans (20)

* "**Enslaves**" (e.g., to legalism, Gal4:9)
* "**Exploits**" *(eat, swallow)* (c.f. Mk12:40)
* "**Takes advantage**" *(take)* (c.f. 2Cor12:16)
* "**Puts on airs**" *(raise up)* (c.f. 2Cor10:5)
* "**Slaps in face**" *(strike)*

>>>

1. to legalism, human authority
2. consume resources/money (cf widows)
3. capture in net, trick (12:16)
4. elevates self
5. deride, insult, humiliate

----------------------------------------

## 1b. You: Corinthians (19)

* "You are so **wise**!": pride in own judgment
* "**Put up** with fools": failure to restrain
* "**Gladly**": with pleasure, delight

>>>
1. Priding yourself on your good judgment
2. Endure, accept, fail to censure: inaction
  + Jam4:16-17, boast in arrogance; does not do the right
3. Delight in this acceptance
  + See doctrinal liberality as a virtue
  + Everyone has a voice
+ personality cult
  + e.g., Jobs
  + 1Cor1:12-13 Paul, Apollo, etc.
  + e.g., mom+son following me

----------------------------------------

## 1c. I: Christ's servant (18, 21a)

* "To my **shame**": Corinthians ashamed of Paul
* "We were too **weak**": c.f. his boasts in v23-28!
* "Boasting in the way the **world** does":
  + According to **flesh**: out of selfish pride
* "**I too** will boast": but not in the same way
  + Content of his boasts is **weakness**!

>>>
1. Dishonour (with irony)
2. Alluding to the content of his boast (v23-28)
3. Corinthians were **impressed** by the boasting
* Paul is not **stooping** to their level, but
  + **Deflating** their claims, in order to
  + Bring the Corinthians back to **simple devotion** to Christ

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:21b-22 (NIV)

Whatever anyone else **dares** to boast about -- <br/>
I am speaking as a **fool** -- <br/>
**I also** dare to boast about.

Are they **Hebrews**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Israelites**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Abrahamâ€™s descendants**? So am I. 

>>>
*dare*: bold, brash, unashamed
+ Paul knows boasting is foolishness
  + 12:1 no profit
  + 11:16 don't deem him to be a fool

----------------------------------------

## 2. Credentials

* Paul **matches** the false apostles' boasting:
* "Hebrews": **nationality**
  + Preserving language / culture
* "Israelites": **theocracy**
  + Preserving covenant with God
* "Abraham's descendants": **Messianic right**
  + Preserving hope of eternal inheritance

>>>
+ Deflate prestige of charlatans
  + 12:11 no less, but also nothing
+ (Jam1:9-10 poor/rich boast in high/low)

----------------------------------------

## Philippians 3:4b-7 (NIV)

If someone else thinks they have reasons <br/>
to put **confidence** in the flesh, I have **more**:

**circumcised** on the eighth day, of the people of **Israel**, <br/>
of the **tribe** of Benjamin, a **Hebrew** of Hebrews; <br/>
in regard to the **law**, a Pharisee; <br/>
as for **zeal**, persecuting the church; <br/>
as for **righteousness** based on the law, faultless.

But whatever were **gains** to me <br/>
I now consider **loss** for the sake of Christ.

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:23 (NIV)

Are they **servants** of Christ? <br/>
(I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am **more**.

I have **worked** much harder, <br/>
been in **prison** more frequently, <br/>
been **flogged** more severely, <br/>
and been exposed to **death** again and again. 

>>>
+ **Exceeds** the charlatans
  + **not** servants of Christ, but of Satan (11:15)
  + not about **degrees** of being a servant
+ Outline of following:
  + 24-25 Beatings
  + 26 Danger of death
  + 27 Toil

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:24-25 (NIV)

**Five** times I received from the Jews <br/>
the forty **lashes** minus one. <br/>
**Three** times I was **beaten** with rods, <br/>
**once** I was pelted with **stones**,

**three** times I was **shipwrecked**, <br/>
I spent a night and a day in the open **sea**,

I have been constantly on the **move**.

>>>
+ Beatings and floggings
+ "Not what Paul has **done**, but what he has **bourne** (Robertson)

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:26-27 (NIV)

I have been in danger from **rivers**, in danger from **bandits**, <br/>
in danger from my fellow **Jews**, in danger from **Gentiles**; <br/>
in danger in the **city**, in danger in the **country**, <br/>
in danger at **sea**; and in danger from **false believers**.

I have **labored** and **toiled** <br/>
and have often gone without **sleep**; <br/>
I have known **hunger** and **thirst** <br/>
and have often gone without **food**; <br/>
I have been **cold** and **naked**. 

>>>
+ Dangers
+ Toil
+ Not for guilt-trip, thanks, or admiration
  + Approval comes from God (10:18), not man
  + Normal Christian life

----------------------------------------

## 3. Crises

>>>
+ Different from typical Chinese whining:
+ Not sufferings overcome by **own** strength
+ But own **frailty**, inability to overcome
  + Glory goes to **God**, not self
+ 1Co1:26-31 boast in the Lord

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:28-30 (NIV)

Besides everything else, <br/>
I face daily the pressure of my **concern** for all the churches.

Who is **weak**, and I do not feel **weak**? <br/>
Who is led into **sin**, and I do not inwardly **burn**?

If I must boast, <br/>
I will boast of the things that show my **weakness**.

----------------------------------------

## 4. Concern

>>>
+ boasting in Corinthians not foolish
  + 12:6 speak truth
  + 10:14 reach Corinthians
  + 10:8 build up not tear down
+ boast of Christ's work
  + Rom15:17-19 Christ's work
