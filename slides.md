## 2 Corinthians 11:18-30

1. Charlatans (v18-20)
2. Credentials (v21-22)
3. Crises (v23-27)
4. Concern (v28-30)

----------------------------------------

## 1. Charlatans (v18-20)

Since many are boasting in the way the world does, <br/>
I too will boast. 

You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! 

In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you<br/>
or exploits you or takes advantage of you<br/>
or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. 

To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that!

----------------------------------------

## 1a. False Apostles (v20)

* "Enslaves": to legalism, human authority
* "Exploits" *(eat, swallow)*: consume/exhaust resources/money
* "Takes advantage" *(take)*: capture as in a net, trick (cf 12:16)
* "Puts on airs" *(take up)*: elevate self
* "Slaps in face" *(strike)*: deride, insult, humiliate

----------------------------------------

## 1b. You (Corinthians) (v19)

* "You are so wise!": priding yourself on your good judgment
* "Put up with fools": endure, accept, do not censure
* "Gladly": with pleasure, desire, sensual delight

----------------------------------------

## 1c. I (Paul) (v18, 21)

* "To my shame" *(dishonour)*: with irony; Corinthians were ashamed of Paul
* "We were too weak": introduces the content of his boast in v23-28
* "Boasting in the way the world does":
  + According to flesh: out of selfish pride
  + Corinthians were impressed by the boasting
* Paul is not stooping to their level, but
  + Deflating their claims, in order to
  + Bring the Corinthians back to simple devotion to Christ

----------------------------------------

## 2. Credentials (v21-22)

Whatever anyone else dares to boast about -- <br/>
I am speaking as a fool -- <br/>
I also dare to boast about.

Are they Hebrews? So am I. <br/>
Are they Israelites? So am I. <br/>
Are they Abrahamâ€™s descendants? So am I. 

----------------------------------------

## 3. Crises (v23-25)

Are they servants of Christ? <br/>
(I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more.

I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, <br/>
been flogged more severely, <br/>
and been exposed to death again and again. 

Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. <br/>
Three times I was beaten with rods, <br/>
once I was pelted with stones, <br/>
three times I was shipwrecked, <br/>
I spent a night and a day in the open sea, 

## 3. Crises (v26-27)

I have been constantly on the move. <br/>
I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, <br/>
in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; <br/>
in danger in the city, in danger in the country, <br/>
in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers.

I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; <br/>
I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; <br/>
I have been cold and naked. 

----------------------------------------

## 4. Concern (v28-30)

Besides everything else, <br/>
I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.

Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? <br/>
Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?

If I must boast, <br/>
I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
