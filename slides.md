## 2 Corinthians 11:18-21a (NIV)

<span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">
Since many are **boasting** in the way the world does, <br/>
**I too** will boast.
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2">
You gladly **put up** with fools since you are so **wise**! <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment blue" data-fragment-index="2">
[Corinthians]
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-blue" data-fragment-index="2">
In fact, you even put up with anyone who **enslaves** you<br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment highlight-red" data-fragment-index="1">
or **exploits** you or **takes advantage** of you<br/>
or puts on **airs** or **slaps** you in the face. <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment red" data-fragment-index="1">
[Charlatans]
</span>

<span class="fragment highlight-green" data-fragment-index="3">
To my shame I admit that we were too **weak** for that! <br/>
</span>
<span class="fragment green" data-fragment-index="3">
[Christ's servant]
</span>

----------------------------------------

## 1a. They: Charlatans (20)

* "**Enslaves**"
* "**Exploits**" *(eat, swallow)*
* "**Takes advantage**" *(take)*
* "**Puts on airs**" *(take up)*
* "**Slaps in face**" *(strike)*

>>>

+ **Enslaves**: to legalism, human authority
+ **Exploits**: consume resources/money (cf widows)
+ **Takes**: capture in net, trick (12:16)
+ **Airs**: elevates self
+ **Slaps**: deride, insult, humiliate

----------------------------------------

## 1b. You: Corinthians (19)

* "You are so **wise**!":
  + Priding yourself on your good judgment
* "**Put up** with fools":
  + Endure, accept, do not censure
* "**Gladly**":
  + With pleasure, desire, sensual delight

>>>
+ personality cult
  + e.g., Jobs
  + 1Cor1:12-13 Paul, Apollo, etc.
  + e.g., mom+son following me

----------------------------------------

## 1c. I: Christ's servant (18, 21a)

* "To my **shame**" *(dishonour)*:
  + With irony; the Corinthians were ashamed of Paul
* "We were too **weak**":
  + Alluding to the content of his boast (v23-28)
* "Boasting in the way the **world** does":
  + According to **flesh**: out of selfish pride
  + Corinthians were **impressed** by the boasting
* Paul is not **stooping** to their level, but
  + **Deflating** their claims, in order to
  + Bring the Corinthians back to **simple devotion** to Christ

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:21b-22 (NIV)

Whatever anyone else **dares** to boast about -- <br/>
I am speaking as a **fool** -- <br/>
**I also** dare to boast about.

Are they **Hebrews**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Israelites**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Abrahamâ€™s descendants**? So am I. 

>>>
*dare*: bold, brash, unashamed
+ Paul knows boasting is foolishness
  + 12:1 no profit
  + 11:16 don't deem him to be a fool

----------------------------------------

## 2. Credentials

* Paul **matches** the false apostles' boasting:
* "Hebrews": **nationality**
  + Preserving language / culture
* "Israelites": **theocracy**
  + Preserving covenant with God
* "Abraham's descendants": **Messianic right**
  + Preserving hope of eternal inheritance

>>>
+ Deflate prestige of charlatans
  + 12:11 no less, but also nothing
+ (Jam1:9-10 poor/rich boast in high/low)

----------------------------------------

## Philippians 3:4b-7 (NIV)

If someone else thinks they have reasons <br/>
to put **confidence** in the flesh, I have **more**:

**circumcised** on the eighth day, of the people of **Israel**, <br/>
of the **tribe** of Benjamin, a **Hebrew** of Hebrews; <br/>
in regard to the **law**, a Pharisee; <br/>
as for **zeal**, persecuting the church; <br/>
as for **righteousness** based on the law, faultless.

But whatever were **gains** to me <br/>
I now consider **loss** for the sake of Christ.

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:23 (NIV)

Are they **servants** of Christ? <br/>
(I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am **more**.

I have **worked** much harder, <br/>
been in **prison** more frequently, <br/>
been **flogged** more severely, <br/>
and been exposed to **death** again and again. 

>>>
+ **Exceeds** the charlatans
  + **not** servants of Christ, but of Satan (11:15)
  + not about **degrees** of being a servant
+ Outline of following:
  + 24-25 Beatings
  + 26 Danger of death
  + 27 Toil

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:24-25 (NIV)

**Five** times I received from the Jews <br/>
the forty **lashes** minus one. <br/>
**Three** times I was **beaten** with rods, <br/>
**once** I was pelted with **stones**,

**three** times I was **shipwrecked**, <br/>
I spent a night and a day in the open **sea**,

I have been constantly on the **move**.

>>>
+ Beatings and floggings
+ "Not what Paul has **done**, but what he has **bourne** (Robertson)

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:26-27 (NIV)

I have been in danger from **rivers**, in danger from **bandits**, <br/>
in danger from my fellow **Jews**, in danger from **Gentiles**; <br/>
in danger in the **city**, in danger in the **country**, <br/>
in danger at **sea**; and in danger from **false believers**.

I have **labored** and **toiled** <br/>
and have often gone without **sleep**; <br/>
I have known **hunger** and **thirst** <br/>
and have often gone without **food**; <br/>
I have been **cold** and **naked**. 

>>>
+ Dangers
+ Toil
+ Not for guilt-trip, thanks, or admiration
  + Approval comes from God (10:18), not man
  + Normal Christian life

----------------------------------------

## 3. Crises

>>>
+ Different from typical Chinese whining:
+ Not sufferings overcome by **own** strength
+ But own **frailty**, inability to overcome
  + Glory goes to **God**, not self
+ 1Co1:26-31 boast in the Lord

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:28-30 (NIV)

Besides everything else, <br/>
I face daily the pressure of my **concern** for all the churches.

Who is **weak**, and I do not feel **weak**? <br/>
Who is led into **sin**, and I do not inwardly **burn**?

If I must boast, <br/>
I will boast of the things that show my **weakness**.

----------------------------------------

## 4. Concern

>>>
+ boasting in Corinthians not foolish
  + 12:6 speak truth
  + 10:14 reach Corinthians
  + 10:8 build up not tear down
+ boast of Christ's work
  + Rom15:17-19 Christ's work
  + 1Th2:19-20 you, our crown
  + 2Co1:12-14 you are our boast
+ 2:2-5 boast only in cross: weakness
  + Gal6:14 only in cross
