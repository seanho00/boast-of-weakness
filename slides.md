## 2 Corinthians 11:18-30

### 1. **Charlatans** (v18-21a)
### 2. **Credentials** (v21b-22)
### 3. **Crises** (v23-27)
### 4. **Concern** (v28-30)

----------------------------------------

## 1. (2Cor 11:18-21a)

Since many are **boasting** in the way the world does, <br/>
**I too** will boast. 

You gladly **put up** with fools since you are so **wise**! 

In fact, you even put up with anyone who **enslaves** you<br/>
or **exploits** you or **takes advantage** of you<br/>
or puts on **airs** or **slaps** you in the face. 

To my shame I admit that we were too **weak** for that!

----------------------------------------

## 1a. Charlatans (20)

* "**Enslaves**":
  + To legalism, human authority
* "**Exploits**" *(eat, swallow)*:
  + Consume / exhaust Corinthians' resources / money
* "**Takes advantage**" *(take)*:
  + Capture as in a net, trick (cf 12:16)
* "**Puts on airs**" *(take up)*:
  + Elevate self
* "**Slaps in face**" *(strike)*:
  + Deride, insult, humiliate

----------------------------------------

## 1b. You (Corinthians) (19)

* "You are so **wise**!":
  + Priding yourself on your good judgment
* "**Put up** with fools":
  + Endure, accept, do not censure
* "**Gladly**":
  + With pleasure, desire, sensual delight

----------------------------------------

## 1c. I (Paul) (18, 21a)

* "To my **shame**" *(dishonour)*:
  + With irony; the Corinthians were ashamed of Paul
* "We were too **weak**":
  + Alluding to the content of his boast (v23-28)
* "Boasting in the way the **world** does":
  + According to **flesh**: out of selfish pride
  + Corinthians were **impressed** by the boasting
* Paul is not **stooping** to their level, but
  + **Deflating** their claims, in order to
  + Bring the Corinthians back to **simple devotion** to Christ

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:21b-22

Whatever anyone else **dares** to boast about -- <br/>
I am speaking as a **fool** -- <br/>
**I also** dare to boast about.

Are they **Hebrews**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Israelites**? So am I. <br/>
Are they **Abrahamâ€™s descendants**? So am I. 

----------------------------------------

## 2. Credentials

* Paul **matches** the false apostles' boasting:
* "Hebrews": **nationality**
  + Preserving language / culture
* "Israelites": **theocracy**
  + Preserving covenant with God
* "Abraham's descendants": **Messianic right**
  + Preserving hope of eternal inheritance

----------------------------------------

## Philippians 3:4b-7

If someone else thinks they have reasons <br/>
to put **confidence** in the flesh, I have **more**:

**circumcised** on the eighth day, of the people of **Israel**, <br/>
of the **tribe** of Benjamin, a **Hebrew** of Hebrews; <br/>
in regard to the **law**, a Pharisee; <br/>
as for **zeal**, persecuting the church; <br/>
as for **righteousness** based on the law, faultless.

But whatever were **gains** to me <br/>
I now consider **loss** for the sake of Christ.

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:23

Are they **servants** of Christ? <br/>
(I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am **more**.

I have **worked** much harder, <br/>
been in **prison** more frequently, <br/>
been **flogged** more severely, <br/>
and been exposed to **death** again and again. 

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:24-25

**Five** times I received from the Jews <br/>
the forty **lashes** minus one. <br/>
**Three** times I was **beaten** with rods, <br/>
**once** I was pelted with **stones**,

**three** times I was **shipwrecked**, <br/>
I spent a night and a day in the open **sea**,

I have been constantly on the **move**.

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:26-27

I have been in danger from **rivers**, in danger from **bandits**, <br/>
in danger from my fellow **Jews**, in danger from **Gentiles**; <br/>
in danger in the **city**, in danger in the **country**, <br/>
in danger at **sea**; and in danger from **false believers**.

I have **labored** and **toiled** <br/>
and have often gone without **sleep**; <br/>
I have known **hunger** and **thirst** <br/>
and have often gone without **food**; <br/>
I have been **cold** and **naked**. 

----------------------------------------

## 3. Crises

----------------------------------------

## 2 Corinthians 11:28-30

Besides everything else, <br/>
I face daily the pressure of my **concern** for all the churches.

Who is **weak**, and I do not feel **weak**? <br/>
Who is led into **sin**, and I do not inwardly **burn**?

If I must boast, <br/>
I will boast of the things that show my **weakness**.

----------------------------------------

## 4. Concern
