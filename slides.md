1. Threat is boastful false apostles

2. Paul meets their credentials, to deflate them
  + Show Corinthians not to be impressed by credentials
3. Paul exceeds them, not in strength but weakness
  + Normal Christian life is full of hardship and suffering
4. Burden not only physical, also spiritual + emotional
  + Paul's concern as a father to his children
